//Use Fake Store AUPI to fetch products data and build a simple products page using Fetch API and React.
//https://fakestoreapi.com/

//1. Use useEffect to call fetch function to call the products API at https://fakestoreapi.com/products 
//2. Save the response into a state called 'products'
//3. Render the products state into the DOM as a simple list of products
//4. Create a <Product /> component that will receive all the keys in the product object as props
//5. Add a Product.css file and make the Product component nicer
//6. Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to arrange the Products in a nicer way on the screen (see attached image for reference)
